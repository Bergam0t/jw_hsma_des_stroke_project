class Patient:
    """
    Representation of an individual patient within the simulation.

    A `Patient` object stores all clinical, pathway, and state-related
    attributes required for modelling flow through the stroke care
    process.

    Several characteristics (onset type, MRS score, diagnosis
    category, admission likelihood) are randomly generated on creation
    (or at the start of assessment) using parameters defined in the global
    configuration class `g`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p_id : int or str
        Unique identifier for the patient.

    Attributes
    ----------
    id : int or str
        Patient identifier.
    q_time_nurse : float
        Time spent waiting for nursing assessment or consultation.
    q_time_ward : float
        Time spent waiting for an inpatient ward bed.
    onset_type : int or float
        Categorisation of onset information (initialized as NaN):
        - 0 : Known onset
        - 1 : Unknown onset but within CTP window
        - 2 : Unknown onset and outside CTP window
    mrs_type : int or float
        Modified Rankin Scale score at presentation (0–5).

    mrs_discharge : int or float
        Modified Rankin Scale score at discharge.
    diagnosis : int or float
        Raw randomised diagnostic value (0–100). Used to map to a clinical
        category based on thresholds defined in `g`.
    patient_diagnosis : int or float
        Encoded diagnosis category:
        - 0 : Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)

    sdec_admit_time : float
        Time admitted to SDEC.
    sdec_discharge_time : float
        Time discharged from SDEC.
    ward_q_start_time : float
        Time patient joined the ward bed queue.
    ward_admit_time : float
        Time admitted to the ward.
    ward_discharge_time : float
        Time discharged from the ward.
    exit_time : float
        Time the patient left the simulation entirely.
    nurse_attending_id : int or float
        ID of the specific nurse resource assigned.
    ct_scanner_id : int or float
        ID of the specific CT scanner resource assigned.
    sdec_bed_id : int or float
        ID of the specific SDEC bed/cubicle assigned.
