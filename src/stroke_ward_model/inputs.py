# MARK: g
# Global class to store parameters for the model.
class g:
    """
    Global simulation configuration parameters.

    This class stores all model-wide constants used in the discrete-event
    simulation, including runtime settings, resource capacities, operational
    constraints, diagnosis-based length-of-stay (LOS) values, cost parameters,
    and state flags modified during execution. All attributes are class
    variables and are intended to be accessed without instantiation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    sim_duration : int
        Total simulated time in minutes (default: 525600, one year).
    number_of_runs : int
        Number of simulation replications.
    warm_up_period : float
        Number of minutes considered warm-up (not included in statistics),
        defined as one-fifth of the total simulation time.

        may change in future. This supersedes the previous note.

        Interarrival time (minutes) for nighttime patient generation.
        NOTE that this is not used in entirely the way that you might expect.
        This may be changed in future.
        NOTE that this has now been changed to be used directly as an average IAT, but this
        may change in future. This supersedes the previous note.
    number_of_nurses : int
        Number of nurses available in the system.

    sdec_unav : bool
        Indicates whether SDEC is unavailable.
    ctp_unav : bool
        Indicates whether CT processing is unavailable.
    write_to_csv : bool
        Whether the simulation should write results to CSV.
