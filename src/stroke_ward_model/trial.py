# Class representing a Trial for our simulation - a batch of simulation runs.


# MARK: Trial class
class Trial:
    """
    Orchestrator for running multiple simulation iterations (runs) and aggregating results.

    The Trial class manages the execution of multiple `Model` instances as defined
    in the global configuration. It collects performance metrics, financial data,
    and patient-level logs from each individual run into centralized DataFrames
    for cross-run analysis.

    Attributes
    ----------
    df_trial_results : pd.DataFrame
        A summary DataFrame where each row represents a single simulation run.
        Tracks metrics such as mean queue times, occupancy, and financial savings.
    model_objects : list
        A collection of `Model` instances created during the trial, allowing
        for post-hoc inspection of specific run states.
    trial_patient_dataframes : list
        A list of DataFrames, each containing detailed attribute data for every
        patient in a specific run.
    trial_patient_df : pd.DataFrame
        The master DataFrame created by concatenating all patient-level data
        across all runs in the trial.
    trial_info : str
        A descriptive string containing the configuration settings used for
        the current trial (e.g., SDEC therapy status and resource availability).

        Executes the batch of simulation runs and aggregates the resulting data.

        This method performs the following steps:

        1. Loops through the number of runs specified in `g.number_of_runs`.

        2. Instantiates and executes a `Model` for each run.

        3. Collects summary metrics (e.g., queue times, savings) into `df_trial_results`.

        4. Flattens patient-level data into a single master DataFrame.

        5. Calculates trial-level means and updates the global `g` class attributes.

        6. Optionally exports results to a CSV file if `g.write_to_csv` is True.

        This method dynamically updates the global configuration class `g` by
        calculating the mean of results across all runs and storing them in
        dictionaries keyed by the trial counter.
