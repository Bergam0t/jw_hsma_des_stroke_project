# Discrete Event Simulation of a Stroke Unit: What impact do specialised stroke same day emergency care units and CT perfusion scanning have on stroke patient flow?

This repository contains a discrete event simulation of **Hyper Acute and Acute Stroke Pathways at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells Trust**.

It focuses on two key components of the stroke pathway:

* **Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC)** - a faster, outpatient-focused pathway where all suspected stroke patients are assessed, with only those needing further care admitted and others discharged the same day with follow‑up support.
* **CT Perfusion (CTP) scanning** - advanced imaging that identifies more patients eligible for time‑critical treatments such as thrombolysis, often shortening length of stay and reducing bed occupancy costs.

The model explores how expanding SDEC opening hours and increasing access to CTP scanning affect patient flow, bed occupancy, treatment rates and overall costs, including whether savings from fewer admissions and shorter stays can more than offset the extra service costs.

The model has helped transformed stroke care, improving outcomes and potentially saving over £2 million a year. To learn move, click below to open an article from the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR):

## Contributors

The majority of the work in this repository has been undertaken by **John Williams** ([jfwilliams4](https://github.com/jfwilliams4)), a Stroke Performance Analyst at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust.

Additional tweaks, documentation creation and web app creation has been undertaken by Sammi Rosser ([Bergam0t](https://github.com/Bergam0t)), a trainer on the HSMA Programme.

## Data used for parameterising the model

This model is parameterised using data from:

- The Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP).
- Locally collected data from Maidstone Hospital.
- General research on stroke care.

<br>

## Environment setup

Install the environment using `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` (tested with Python 3.12.10), found in the `environment/` folder. For example:

```
conda env create --file environment/environment.yml
```

This should automatically install the model code. If you receive errors about `stroke_ward_model` not being found in the environment you created then run: `pip install -e .`

**Note:** Legacy environments are also available in `win_environment/` and `mac_environment/`, but it is recommended that you use those provided in `environment/`.

<br>

## Running the model

To run the model via a script, run:

```
python scripts/run_stroke_admission_model.py
```

You will be prompted for inputs:

* Write results to CSV?
* Generate graph per run?
* Choose number of ward beds
* Run SDEC with full therapy support?
* What percentage of the day should the SDEC be available?
* What percentage of the day should the CTP be available?

The typical runtime is around 2-3 minutes.

<br>

## Web app

It is possible to run the model via a script, but for easy access to model parameters and all results tables and outputs, it is recommended to use the web app interface.

The hosted web app is available at [stroke-des.streamlit.app/](https://stroke-des.streamlit.app/).

[![Screenshot from the web app](docs/assets/app_preview.png)](https://stroke-des.streamlit.app/)

If you are unable to install Python code locally, you can use this free hosted version of the app, though note it may run more slowly.

To run the web app locally, you will need to install a separate environment provided in the `app/` folder. This is a reduced environment used by the hosted version of the web app on Streamlit Community Cloud. It does not install `mkdocs`, `pytest`, and other packages needed only for wider repository tasks. This `app/` environment must be manually updated whenever changes are made to the files in `environment/`.

Once the environment is installed, open a terminal in the root of the repository and run:

```
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

<br>

## Parametrisation and preprocessing

If you want to re-parametrise the model using your own local data, use the notebook:

```
preprocessing/preprocessing.ipynb
```

This notebook reads in CSV files and suggests distributions and parameters for:

* Inter-arrival times (separate in-hours and out-of-hours).
* MRS score on presentation.
* Length of stay (by modified rankin score (MRS) on presentation and stroke type).

When you run it, it writes out CSV files in the `preprocessing/` folder that you can use to update `src/stroke_ward_model/inputs.py` and `src/stroke_ward_model/distributions.py`.

The notebook expects CSV files in `input_data/` with the following columns:

* `los.csv`: `diagnosis`, `mrs`, `los` (days).
* `iat.csv`: `in-hours`, `out-of-hours` (minutes between arrivals).

The `los.csv` and `iat.csv` included in this repository are dummy examples for structure only - they are not real data and should be replaced with your own before using results for decision-making.

## Exploring the model via GitHub Codespaces

You can run and experiment with the model in an online VS Code environment using GitHub Codespaces, without installing anything locally.

1. Ensure you are logged in to GitHub and have access to GitHub Codespaces.
2. Click the green **Code** button on this repository.
3. Select the **Codespaces** tab, then choose **Create codespace on main** (or another branch if you prefer).

GitHub will create a new Codespace using the pre-configured development container. Once it's ready, a VS Code editor will open in your browser with the repository loaded.

In the integrated terminal, run the provided scripts or commands (e.g., to execute the simulation or tests) and explore or modify the model directly in this environment.

<br>

## Changelog

Please note all changes made to the code in the file `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.

<br>

## Tests

The test suite can be run with the `pytest --html-output=docs/` command.

This will run the tests as well as generating a rich html report, which will then also be made available in the documentation.

<br>

## Documentation

The documentation site is provided using mkdocs-material and mkdocstrings.

It can be accessed at [sammirosser.com/jw_hsma_des_stroke_project/](http://sammirosser.com/jw_hsma_des_stroke_project/)

### Updating the documentation

The changelog will automatically be pulled into the documentation.

Additional pages can be written in markdown and placed into the docs folder.

You must then add them to the 'nav' section of the file `mkdocs.yml`, which is present in the root folder.

The pages for the key model classes are built automatically, and new attributes, parameters and methods will be added to the documentation automatically as long as they are documented in the docstrings. If you add new classes or functions which need to be documented, follow the pattern used in the `docs/g.md` file for your new class, making sure to add it to the 'nav' section as with any other page.

You can preview the docs with the command `mkdocs serve`.

However, all publishing of the site is handled by GitHub actions (.github/workflows/publish-docs.yml); you do not need to build the documentation locally for it to update.

### Setting up the documentation after forking

**If you are forking this repository**, you will need to go to your repository settings, then to 'pages', and choose 'Deploy from a branch', then make sure it is set to 'gh-pages' '/(root)', then save your selection.

The provided GitHub actions workflow in the .github/workflows/publish-docs.yml file will then be able to publish the docs to your page.

You will also need to update the `site_url` and `repository_url` parameter in the `mkdocs.yml` to reflect their new paths.

If you are not using a custom domain, the site will follow the pattern `http://your-github-username.github.io/your-forked-repository-name`
