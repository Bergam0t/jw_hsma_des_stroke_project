As the number of stroke patients nationally rises the pressure on the already resourced stretched NHS will rise.<br><br>In stroke care time critical interventions are key, patients need to be in the right place and within the correct time frames to receive treatment. Maintaining efficient flow from the ambulance to ED to the stroke unit itself is essential to meet these time critical interventions and the following monitoring.<br><br>Flow is not only vital for early interventions but also for the stroke unit’s workforce. A ward with higher occupancy puts pressure on the unit's medical, nursing and therapy staff. Higher ward occupancy leads to lowering staff patient ratios when staffing levels remain the same, reducing the quality of care and therapy input per patient.<br><br>The purpose of this model is to assess the effect of changing variables on stroke unit flow and occupancy, to simulate different approaches to address the increasing pressure all stroke units in the UK will face in the coming years. The models key areas of focus are on the number of beds a ward possesses, the utilisation of the CT perfusion and the stroke SDEC model developed and currently operational at Maidstone Hospital.<br><br>There is also a large focus on the financial savings generated from utilising CT perfusion and a stroke SDEC model, as both require an upfront investment, however are inherently cost saving through bed days saved. The secondary purpose of the model is to show that not only is the utilisation of CTP and stroke SDEC beneficial to patient flow and ward occupancy but also cost saving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Scenario logic                   | 2.3    | Give details of the logical difference between the base case model and scenarios (if any).  This could be incorporated as text or where differences are substantial could be incorporated in the same manner as 2.2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | If CT perfusion scanner availability is greater than 0, patients who complete their nurse triage step while scanners are available will instead undergo a CT perfusion scan. For patients with an unknown stroke onset time who were otherwise eligible for thrombolysis, this makes them eligible for thrombolysis, which has a 50% chance to lead to a 1 point improvement in MRS on discharge compared to the same patient not undergoing thrombolysis, and also reduces LOS to 75% of the originally sampled LOS duration for that patient (i.e. their stay duration is reduced by 25%). <br><br>If SDEC availability is greater than 0, patients who complete their CT or CT perfusion scan while the SDEC is open and has an available bed will be admitted to the SDEC instead of the inpatient ward. A subset of these patients will be considered eligible for avoiding a full subsequent admission and will be tagged as such. Further details of the criteria for admission avoidance are detailed in section 2.5.3.<br><br>If SDEC therapy support is enabled, more patients will become eligible for admission avoidance. This is again detailed in section 2.5.3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Duration is generated using an exponential distribution parameterised from historical data. <br><br>CT or CT perfusion scanning = after triage, entities leave the nurse and undergo either a CT or CT perfusion (advanced CT) scan for a generated amount of time. Duration is generated using an exponential distribution parameterised from historical data. <br><br>Thrombolysis = if eligible, patients will undergo thrombolysis. The time taken for this is not modelled; it purely affects eventual LOS if patients are admitted to the stroke ward.<br><br>Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC) = if SDEC is open and has capacity, all patients are admitted to the SDEC after scanning. <br><br>Ward stay = if admission is not avoided (see 2.5.3), entities are admitted to the main stroke ward for a generated amount of time. Patients may go straight from the CT/CTP scanning step if the SDEC is not open or is at capacity, or may move from the SDEC to the main ward. LOS is generated using an exponential distribution parameterised from historical data, stratified by Modified Rankin Scale on admission and stroke type, and adjusted by a defined proportion if thrombolysis is administered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This is the first step in the patient pathway after patients are generated.<br>The nurse resource is released when the patient moves on to scanning. <br><br>Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC) beds<br>After a patient has been seen by a nurse and received either a CT or CT perfusion (CTP) scan, they will be admitted to the same day emergency care ward if the ward is currently operating and if there is sufficient capacity. <br>The number of SDEC beds available defaults to 5. <br><br>Inpatient Ward beds<br>If the SDEC is not operating at the time a patient finishes their CT/CTP scan, or if SDEC is operating but at capacity, patient will be admitted to an inpatient ward bed if available.<br> <br>Patients will also move to an inpatient ward bed after their SDEC stay if they are not a candidate for admission avoidance. Admission avoidance is considered to occur in the following situations: <br>- patient diagnosis is 0 or 1 AND mrs type is 0 or 1 AND the patient is not thrombolysed AND therapy is NOT available within the SDEC<br>- patient diagnosis is 0 or 1 AND mrs type is 0, 1 or 2 AND the patient is not thrombolysed AND therapy is available within the SDEC<br>- patient diagnosis is 2 (transient ischaemic attack) AND the randomised patient non-admission chance is higher than the globally defined TIA admission chance<br>- patient diagnosis is 3 or 4 (stroke mimic or non-stroke) AND the randomised patient non-admission chance is higher than the globally defined stroke mimic admission chance<br><br>If a bed is unavailble, patients will wait for a bed to become available. It is assumed that during this time they will be admitted to an alternative ward in the wider hospital where space is available, before being moved to this more appropriate ward as soon as a bed becomes available, with beds being allocated purely in the order that patients arrive. <br><br>Unused constrained resources<br>The model creates an attribute relating to the number of CT perfusion (CTP) scanners within the model. However, this attribute is not currently used within the model. Instead, standard CT scanning capacity is assumed to always be available.
