# Try out the Model

The model is hosted on a free hosting platform - Streamlit Community Cloud.

You can use this to try out the model without having to run any code locally.

!!! note

    If you are using the app for decision-making, it is recommended that you run it locally, which will allow for much faster running of multiple scenarios across a higher number of runs or a longer timeframe.

You can take a quick look at the app below. However, for the best experience, we'd recommend you open it in a new window.
