# Running the model locally

## Environment setup

Install the environment using `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` (tested with Python 3.12.10), found in the `environment/` folder.

This should automatically install the model code. If you receive errors about `stroke_ward_model` not being found in the environment you created then run: `pip install -e .`

**Note:** Legacy environments are also available in `win_environment/` and `mac_environment/`, but it is recommended that you use those provided in `environment/`.

## Running the model

To run the model via a script, with prompts for input variables, run the file `scripts/run_stroke_admission_model.py`.

## Web App

It is possible to run the model via a script, but for easy access to model parameters and all results tables and outputs, it is recommended to use the web app interface.

The hosted web app is available at [stroke-des.streamlit.app/](https://stroke-des.streamlit.app/). If you are unable to install Python code locally, you can use this free hosted version of the app, though note it may run more slowly.

To run the web app locally, you will need to install a separate environment provided in the `app/` folder. This is a reduced environment used by the hosted version of the web app on Streamlit Community Cloud. It does not install `mkdocs`, `pytest`, and other packages needed only for wider repository tasks. This `app/` environment must be manually updated whenever changes are made to the files in `environment/`.

Once the environment is installed, open a terminal in the root of the repository and run:

```
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```
