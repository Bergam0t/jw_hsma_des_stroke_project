# Discrete Event Simulation of a Stroke Unit

# What impact do specialised stroke same day emergency care (SDEC) units and CT perfusion scanning have on stroke patient flow?

Welcome to the documentation for this discrete event simulation.

This model is designed to help answer questions about the impact of CT perfusion scanner availability and the use of a specialised stroke SDEC on stroke ward capacity, the suitable number of beds, and potential cost-savings from increased use of these approaches.

## Where can I find out more?

This documentation contains technical details of the modelling code.

For a higher-level overview, you can find details in the Streamlit app.

Details of how to run the Streamlit app locally can be found [in the repository readme](https://https://github.com/Bergam0t/jw_hsma_des_stroke_project).
